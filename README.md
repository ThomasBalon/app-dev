<dt>Plot:</dt>
<dd><i>Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias "Neo", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape via a scaffold. The Agents attempt to bribe Neo into helping them locate Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist (and the most dangerous man alive), by offering to erase Neo's criminal record. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic "bug" in his stomach. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo, indicating that the "nightmare" he experienced was apparently real.</i></dd>
